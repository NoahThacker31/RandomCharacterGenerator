README

Install:
   If you are reading this, then you have already unzipped the zip folder.  Congratulations, you have installed Random Character Generator.

Use:
   All you need to do now is double click "RandomCharacterGenerator.exe" in the main folder, and ignore the other folders (bin and jre).
   A new folder will be created called "Characters".  "Character 01.txt" will be created, and the number will be automatically incremented
   each time you create a new character.  Open the .txt file and make your character based on the text.  Good luck.
   Best if loading a save before the sewers exit.
